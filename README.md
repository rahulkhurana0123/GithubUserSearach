# Search Git User

Github User Search application makes a service call through retrofit2 library and populates a recyclerview with list of users and repo details. Clicking on an Item would navigate the user to a detailed story.

# Dependency Libraries used

- Dagger2 for dependency injection
- RxJava and RxBinding
- Picasso for Image rendering
- Retrofit for network calls using coroutines Adapter
- GSON with Retrofit
- Mockito for mocking object in Unit test cases
- Room persistence library

# Architectural Pattern
  MVVM with Live Data

Declarative UI in XML using DataBinding.

Took advantage of Material designs and used recyclerView and cardViews with elevation.
